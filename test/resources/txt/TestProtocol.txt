#############################################################################

There is a set of automated tests that can be triggered by executing
"make test" at the top level build directory and that also gets executed
automatically by a Continuous Integration server (Jenkins in our case)
whenever a new revision is pushed to the source code repository. 

Some of these are simple smoke test: start executable to check that it
runs. The gtester executable (cfr bin directory in the installation tree)
executes unit tests. The gtester can also be run from its installed
location..
