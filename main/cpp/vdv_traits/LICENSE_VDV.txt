As it stands now, the sources in the directories 
src/main/cpp/vdv_basics and src/main/cpp/vdv_traits are
based on source code of Vandevoorde and Josuttis's book entitled 
''C++ Templates: The Complete Guide'' by Addison-Wesley.
  
Some changes have been effected. The programs are built using CMake i.o. make.
A few very minor changes were made in the sources (sometimes to appease the 
compiler, sometimes to include a main program to demonstrate a feature). 
Also I modified the coding style somewhat to make it easier to include 
some of the code in the course notes.
 
The copyright statement by Vandevoorde and Josuttis on the sources 
still applies. It states:

/* The following code example is taken from the book
 * "C++ Templates - The Complete Guide"
 * by David Vandevoorde and Nicolai M. Josuttis, Addison-Wesley, 2002
 *
 * (C) Copyright David Vandevoorde and Nicolai M. Josuttis 2002.
 * Permission to copy, use, modify, sell and distribute this software
 * is granted provided this copyright notice appears in all copies.
 * This software is provided "as is" without express or implied
 * warranty, and with no claim as to its suitability for any purpose.
 */

Because some of the examples get included in my course notes, I have eliminated 
the copyright statement it from the individual files in favor of this file.
